The advocate for playing sports is universal. Yet there are some views that sports are not that important comparing to other form of learning like reading astronomically amount of books, which impart the lessons about life to the readers more clearly. However, I deem it the other way that playing sports teaches people more about life, even more than usual learning ways like reading.

To start with, playing sports have physical benefit, and physical health is the most valuable lesson that human beings get when they are older. Many elderly are quite crazy about sports. There are breaking daily news reporting that 90-year-old swimming group wins a prize. Because they taste the great secret to being energized like the young, that is doing sport! Through the process of exercising and doing those sports, they feel a sense of fullfillment and get improved physically. Additionally, 

Furthermore, lessons that the simple is causation of happiness are taught in the process. Sports are usually made up of commonly agreed ways to play. The rules are fairly simple comparing to those complex math equations. For instance, when playing the table tennis, we push the ball to the other part of the table. If the ball bounce for only once, it means it is a successful push. And the total actions , running, jumping and pushing turns out to part of human nature. We are thus get happy in those simple actions.

Though it is true that reading books is also a effective to get lessons, where many experiences and successful stories are written, sports turns out to be a more direct way. Doing sports is like experimenting by ourselves, while reading books require a process of understanding the method and then apply to the reality. Additionally, doing sports are much more simple. Everyone get headable at those philosophy books telling some complexed stories. Sports involved simple actions like jumping, running and walking. And simple actions give rise to mental relieve. 

Therefore, it is safe to conclude that sports teaches people more about life. Doing sports is able to benefit people mentally and physically. Those simple actions are possible to give rise to a sense of achievement and happiness. And its direct and simple process is uncomparable to other form of learning about life.
