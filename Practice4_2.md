Some people always follow their dreams even if the dreams are ambitious. Some think we should focus on achieving realistic goals. Which do you agree with? Why?

# My writing

The pursuit for dreams is universal. Numerous people are encouraged and struggled to earn a better life, holding dream in the heart consistently. While some commons have a tendency to concentrate on bread and milk on the table, meeting everyday needs and having a mundane life.  Anyway, I deem that the young are supposed to live a more exciting life and follow their dreams even if the dreams are ambitious.

Firstly, the pursuit of dreaming provides motivation and encouragement to the mundane life. Most of the work we do are quite repetitive like going to school in the early morning and having meals in the noon. Sandwiched between the seemingly hectic schedule, we are easily bored and feel no motivation for the future. Dreams, however, give us the hope and direction. For instance, I am always in eager to pursue my master degree in the United States for its high education quality and experiencing different culture at the same time. I have been improving myself in the direction. Though astronomically huge amount of same work to finish in my major, I try my best to find a balance and take away some time for preparing the language test and GRE test. The dream for studying in the United States direct me clearly on the path that I should take.

Secondly, the expectancy of life quite limited, being young is a merry episode in the entire life, yet fairly short. It is truth that one can only be twenty once. The young have the energy and all kinds of ambitious plan. And it is thus worthwhile to hold on to the dream and give it a shot. History has already reflected that most of the awesome works are made by the young. Albert Einstein published his quantum theory in his 20s, and Bill Gates dropped out of Harvard and started to develop Microsoft successfully in his 30s. From my perspective, however ambitious the dreams of the young seem, the young have the power to make it come true and change the world.

Finally, sometimes pursuing the dreams might be quite insane in the eyes of the surrounding people. Having a steady income and a secured job is what the parents more expect their child to do. The kind of regular life and the achieving of realistic goals are easier to recognized and realized. But if there is someone who have done that before, that is doing the regular jobs perfectly, having a secure job and a family and live in the same schedule, why we are going to repeat their success and repeat all the work one by one. Every individual is bound to have a quite different life and experience something different instead of resembling those high-quality machines being produced out of the factory.

Therefore, I hold the view that we young are supposed to pursue the dreams however ambitious they are. Because dreams add much creativity and motivations to the daily life. They also give a short life something to pursue and a clear direction. Insane might it is, it is our young's responsibility to do something different.
