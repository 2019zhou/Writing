City dwellers are increasingly busy with overwhelming pressure from the work and family. Some people hold the view that we should not expect people to be as polite as before, because the routine of being polite add much more burden to the usual fast-paced life. Anyway, being polite consumes time. However, I deem it the other way. Politeness is essential even in this fast pace society.

To begin with, the politeness adds to the harmonious and relaxation of the otherwise tense atmosphere. When dealing with a tough problem, like arguing about the future development direction of a company, the core members may try every way persuade others with his plan. It is easy to find disagreement here. And quarrels and anger occasionally occur. Politeness play its role at this circumstance, calm down the two members mood and relax the tense atmosphere. It can be a simple sentence like "I really appreciate your proposal, but there are still sometimes improvements to be made". But it virtually contributes to more effective listening and more constructive suggestions. To be honest, the more dire the situation, the harder it is to keep polite. And more necessity it is.

Furthermore, leaving a good impression to others is increasingly important in this busy and crowded world. And the most direct and effective way is absolutely being politeness. Dressing a suit and follow the local routine are easiest way to make others admiring you and welcome you. Anyway, good manners are striking quality of humanity, as traditional virtue to be pass on. It is part of human nature to judge others by the aspect of appearance and courtesy. Why not having a good manner instead of finding other various much more difficult method like being highly professional to make a good relation?

Finally, the burden to being politeness is not astronomically huge. Being civil is not like completing the ten complicated procedures before lunch as in some culture do. It can simply be a few words and a warm smile. And dressing properly is taught in the kindergarten. It is true that the pressure and burden that overwhelming the current common human being is far too much. But all the good manners are definitely not something that is to cut. On the contrary, being politeness is something that require advocating and promotion.

Therefore, I expect people to be polite, at least obeying the basic criteria of being polite. Having good manners give rise to a harmonious atmosphere and relax the otherwise tense situation. It also leads to good understanding and relations among people is the easiest way possible. Comparing to the other complicated routines, it will not add that tremendous burden to the usual life. So, it is acceptive and encouraging to be polite.
