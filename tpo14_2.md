Travelling in the own country has many benefits. It can be a short journey so that one can make the travelling expense within the budget. What is more, people in the same country have more in common and to strike a chord with them. However, I deem it the other way around.

First, travelling to foreign countries is the experience of embracing the other kind of culture. This is especially true for the westerner who choose to travel to east or the easterners choose to travel to the west. The great difference between the two cultures is supposed to add much freshness and excitedness to the traveler's mind. And this kind of freshness and excitedness can be very beneficial. It is helpful to get recovery from the usual hurts. While travelling within the country may make you feel you are still in the same environment for changes are not that big.

Secondly, travelling to foreign country may be beneficial to the personal ability, liking getting accustomed to new environment quickly and tackling the emergencies in a very short time. Those abilities prove to very essential to one's individual development. And in a totally different environment just provide a perfect opportunity to practice them. 

Thirdly, the initial motivation for travelling is that I travel because the place is there. Great, awesome works of nature, modern building built by human and those harmonious relations between the nature and human, these are all something human should go to appreciate. If one just goes within the country, the sceneries cannot be that various. And one cannot appreciate very different buildings. But those great works are just there, why not just have a travel there and experience all the greatness?

In a nutshell, I will choose to travel to foreign countries even if it means a bigger budget and more tough travel. Trust me, it will worth it. It is worthwhile to get relieve from the everyday tiredness and strengthen your ability to fit in new and tackle the hard hut. It is also in accord with the initial motivation for why one must travel, to see the place that already there.
