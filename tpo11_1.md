In terms of whether young people are reading far less literature and novels, the lecture and the reading passage are contradictory to each other.

The literature can provide intellectual stimulations for readers. But there are many other forms that can be intellectual-stimulating. Many movies, magazines and music can be of high quality and proved to be thought-provoking. There are replacements for the literature that can offer the same exercise of imaginations, empathize and understanding of language with easier way, that is no need to read that much difficult literature articles.

In addition, the replacement for the literature is claimed to be superficial poorly written and intellectually undemanding. But they are not. They might be very easy to read or say experience directly. For music and movies can be very high-quality. They just achieve both the directness and thoughtfulness. Therefore, do some reading other than literature does not necessarily lower the level of culture.

Last but not the least, readers are not to be blame in the case of talented writers lacking audience for modern literature is sometimes hard to understand. even if you use the 'modern art' to show to the readers in the past, they may not have the patience to read them through, too. Writers are supposed to reflect on writing some easier for reading material for readers.

In a nutshell, the lecture points out the possible, more promising result of the literature decline circumstance. Other forms can achieve the same result with more directness. And modern literature on the other hand may be too hard and obscure, which may be another cause for readers declining.
