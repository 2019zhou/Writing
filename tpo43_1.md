## 3 theories about the agnostids
1. free-swimming predators
2. parasite
3. living on the sea floor

Agnostids are extinct marine animals and three theories are proposed by the paleontologists to find out how the Agnostid were behaving or eating in the reading passage. But the professor in the listening parts refutes the three theories pointing out that they are contradictory to the exist facts.

To begin with, the first theory that the Agnostids are free-swimming predators like some other primitive arthropods may not hold water. Because those primitive arthropods generally have well-developed eyes to exhibit behaviors of predation. However, agnostid actually have very poor eyesight, some of them are even blind. Additionally, there are no evidence for other sensitive organ that the agnostid have to do the hunting job. 

Furthermore, it is asserted possible that the agnostids have dwelled on the sea floor by scavenging dead organisms or by grazing on bacteria. But the professor contends that the feature of animals living on the sea floor is they move very slow while the agnostids are not. Animals living on the sea floor only occupy a limited geography area and go nowhere else. But the agnostids are find in multiple areas in large quantities. This shows that agnostids possess the ability to move from one place to the another swiftly, which is definitely very unusual and contradictory to the theory.

Finally, the theory that the agnostids were parasites, living on and feeding off larger organisms, has defect according to the professor. Parasites usually have a popularity that is not that large. Because if there is too many parasites, they will kill off the host organismm. The agnostids, however, have a really large amount even in the fossil. Therefore, in terms of the agnostids's size, the theory is not right.
