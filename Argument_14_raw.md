# Title
The following appeared as part of an article in a business magazine.

A recent study rating 300 male and female Mentian advertising executives according to the average number of hours they sleep per night showed an association between the amount of sleep the executives need and the success of their firms. Of the advertising firms studied, those whose executives reported needing no more than 6 hours of sleep per night had higher profit margins and faster growth. These results suggest that if a business wants to prosper, it should hire only people who need less than 6 hours of sleep per night.

Write a response in which you examine the stated and/or unstated assumptions of the argument. Be sure to explain how the argument depends on these assumptions and what the implications are for the argument if the assumptions prove unwarranted.

# My writing 
While it may be true that advertising executives with a prosperous business generally do sleep less than the counterparts in less successful business, it definitely does not indicate there is a causation between the amount of sleep and the success of the business. So, the author assumption that the amount of sleep give rise to the bussiness prosperity is untenable, based on which the argument is prone to be groundless.

In the study of Mendian advertising exercutives, the author mentions the number of people for survey with both male and female. However, 300 is definitely far from a ample sample because the even the number of companies is hundreds of thousands of. Moreover, the author could increase the scope of the survey with executives with a more diversity background. Additionally, The author did not mention the evaluation standard for the prosperity of a bussiness and the proportion of male and female. Therefore, unless these survey is amply verified and proved reliable for the selection of sample and a larger amounts of exercutives is participated, the assumption of the existence of relationship between the amount of sleep and the prosperous of the business cannot effectively backup the argument. 

Supposed that the relationship between the amount of sleep and prosperity of the firm does exist, it does not mean there is a causation between the two. Why is that less sleep give rise to the prosperity of the firm rather than the prosperity of firm forces or motivates the marketing exercutive, thus leading to a generally less amount of sleep. According to the common sense, I tend to support the later. Because a outperform firm usually have a larger scale with more employees,  more departments and larger markets, the work load for the marketing exercutive would be significantly heavier than the smaller scale firm. It is more likely for that marketing exercutive to find endless work to do and have to stay up late to get the work done. On top of that, a flourishing firm usually has a better motivivating mechanism. The rule in the firm can be that the markerting exercutives can get paid for all the additional effort, thus motivating them to work longer and sleep less. Therefore, assumption that sleep gives rise to the booming of the firm cannot hold water, failing to support the suggestion for the company for only hiring people sleep less.

Finally, during the process of a firm growth, the author apparently ignores the other factors that may contribute to rapid firm development. Even if the amount of sleep proves to be a factor, there are many other possible causes that may prove to be even more decisive to the successful development. What if the firm pay the salary according to the performance of the advertisting? In this case, the salary may be the real motivation and causes for the success rather than sleeping time. What if the firm's flexible schedule and good canteen that attracts more capable and devoted people into the firm that results in higher profit margins? In this case, the wellfare and the talents are the key to the blooming firm. So, it is unwise for the author roughly reaching the argument to limit the marketing exercutives only to those sleep less supposing that sleeping time to be the decisive factor for that ourperformance.

All in all, it is unconvincing for the author to argue that firm should only hire people with less than 6 hours sleep based on the assumption that the less sleep gives rise to the prosperity of the firm in that the study is not valid and persuative enough, the caustion between the sleep and the prosperity of the firm is unlikely to be tenable and the ignorance of other factors that might even be more decisive than the amount of sleep factor.
