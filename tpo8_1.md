The reading passage questions the authenticity and credibility of the Chevalier 's memoir from three major aspects. However, the professor in the listening part refutes all of the doubts and defends the Chevalier's work.

First, the professor argues that Chevalier is rich. Chevalier did participate in many parties and gambling there. In terms of the loan case, that is borrowing considerable sums of money from a Swiss merchant, it is explained that the money needs a few days to turnover. Chevalier did have much wealth, but he needed to sell them and convert them into case. Considering that he involved in the gambling which require large sums of money in a short time, it is reasonable that when the Chevalier has run out of the cash, he inevitably asked for the merchant to borrow the money.

Secondly, Chevalier's inability to remember the whole conversation with Voltaire cannot hold water in that Chevalier can refer to the notes he did when communicating with Voltaire. Chevalier mentions that when he always wrote down all the details every time after he did an conversation with Voltaire. Also, as a matter of fact, there is evidence that when Chevalier wrote the memoir, he often consulted the notes and journal he did in the past. And it is of high possibility that he kept the conversation for many years. 

Thirdly, the professor affirmed that Chevalier's account of escaping form the notorious prison is authentic. There are records in the document that as soon as Chevalier got out of the prison, the ceiling of the cell requires repairing. It is absolutely not a coincidence. Moreover, many prisoners in the bar turns out to have much more and more powerful politically well-connected friends in Venice. But they did not get out of the prison. Therefore, Chevalier is supposed to escaped the Venetian prison by himself by making that hole in the ceiling rather than bribing the jailers to be freed.
