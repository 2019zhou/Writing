do you agree or disagree with the following statement? the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.


The way to travel has always been something to debate. It just has much impact on the travel's quality and also feelings of the whole trip. In my view, travelling in a group by a tour guide is a better way.

First, travelling in a group led by a tour guide ensures safety greatly, which is a key measurement for a tour. Only a safe trip worth the time, money and all the energy devoted to it. Group tour means that every member in a group can help each other and solve the emergency together rather than tackling with the hard nut alone. Additionally, tour guide is especially useful for safety when it comes to specific situations. For instance, when people try to climb a high mountain with very few people on it, tour guide come to their assistance to figure out the which road to take without getting loss.

Secondly, a group and a tour guide are can make you part of the destination quickly. One may feel great uneasiness when they arrived at a new destination considering the different climate of the two places and long and tired trip to get there.  And an experience tour guide helps a lot. Tour guide is familiar with the local situation, and he or she is able to get you quickly accustomed to the environment at the travel destination. Tour guide is able to get you know the local customs quickly, preventing you from not observing local taboos and know the local cultures and history swiftly.

Thirdly, travelling with a group and a tour guide is both time-efficient and economic, that is to say, one just saves much trouble and save the money at the same time. For city dwellers nowadays, sometimes it is just unrealistic to find enough time out for a self-trip. Holiday time is so precious. Why not find a travel that save much more time? On top of that, group trip usually has a rather great discount and the tour agency will help find the hidden discounts which are hard to find by oneself. For example, when I went to the Disneyland in Shanghai, it turns out that group ticket is significantly lower than the normal individual ticket. 

In a nutshell, travelling in a group led by a tour guide just have much benefit that otherwise cannot have. Travelling with them ensure safety, be localize quickly and save much time and money. Therefore, I will choose to travel in a group led by a tour guide.
