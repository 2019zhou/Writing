Glass is very dangerous for wild birds. The reading passage proposes three solutions to prevent injuries to birds: one-way glass, colorful designs and magnetic field. However, the professor in the listening part refutes the proposal and argues that none of the three solutions is operative.

First, the reading passages says that one-way glass that is transparent in only one direction and the birds will not try to fly through because they cannot see through it. However, the professor contends that, it is true but the windows will reflect just like a mirror. The birds won't understand it is a  glass and take it for true mirror. And they feel the reflecting is attracting them. If they see some trees and sky in the "mirror", they will fly into them without hesitation. Therefore, one-way glass failed to serve as a prevention for birds to fly into.

Secondly, the colorful designs painted on regular windows, like a design of thin stripes painted over the glass, is not effective according to the professor. Because those openings which people use to see through to watch the outside, will be perceived as open holes by the birds. The birds are thus likely to try to fly right through and be seriously injured. Additionally, considering the reason analyzed above, the unpainted areas on some windows are intentionally made extremely small. But without much of the glass enabling the light, it turns out to be really dark for the people inside. 

Thirdly, the magnetic field solution, that is to create an artificial magnetic filed to guide birds away from building, might failed to work as the professor claims. Because though it is true that it is  natural ability of birds to sense Earth's magnetic fields and use them to navigate in the right direction. The kind of natural ability is used only when birds travel very long distances, like migrate to some warm places in winter. The ability is not used when crossing some short distances, like flying from one city to the another, in which case, the birds usually only use eyes and brightness of the light to navigate the road. Therefore, this solution might fail to work too.

In conclusion, the three solutions proposed in the reading passage is unlikely to work according to the professor.
