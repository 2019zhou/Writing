Technology have made huge changes to the life for a child. Instead of playing freely on the field, children nowadays just stare at the screen or lying on the sofa watching endless soap drama. Points are raised that children are less creative than they were in the past because of technology. However, I deem it the other way around.

Technology have made children become creative in the way society becomes. Those overwhelming scenes in the film and thrilling plots of a computer games are becoming part of children's life. Children are thus more likely to be motivated to create those great plots and scenes by themselves. More and more children are trying to learn some coding skills to work for those game companies when they grow up. They use the creativity and imaginations which have been developed at their children's age to become their career. Children are creative in non-traditional ways but they fit more into the society.

Additionally, in many circumstances technology just become the equipment and do its assistance to better experience the physical world. For example, children learn those basic skills in more vivid cartoons. And some virtual technology just makes the children experience the things that are not so usual in every life. With better and broad experiences, children can have more knowledge about the things and thus become more creative. For example, it might be nearly impossible for a child to experience the life of an astronomer. With virtual technology, children can go on a spacecraft and start a journey seafaring the whole galaxy by himself/herself. That would be an exciting time. Children are very likely to be inspired by this kind of experience and make some creation and imaginations happily.

All in all, from where I stand, technology will just make children more creative rather than do something backward.
