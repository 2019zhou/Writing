- **prompt**: Critical judgment of work in any given field has little value unless it comes from someone who is an expert in that field.	

- **direction**: Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statement and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold true and explain how these considerations shape your position.


The author's assertion that all the critical judgment work must come from experts in that field is an underestimation of the wisdom of the general public and, in my view, the assertion holds true only in very few circumstances like in pure physics or math science field.

It is true that experts are more likely to give a critical judgment that is very valuable. Especially in the fields like pure physics and mathematics. Because the concept and methodologies that construct the whole theory are out of the scope of mass's acknowledgment that the mass are barely able to judge on the work. Even with a seemingly reasonable judgment, the mass is reaching their conclusion with a mixture of conjecture and speculation. Take myself for example, after receiving a complete education for fourteen years. I feel puzzled at the total meaning of the serious paper of pure physics even though every line in the paper are clear and concise. It is a gradually accepted fact in academic field when entering some detailed field of math or physics, one will find the academic circles dwindle sharply that there are actually maybe ten people doing this work all over the world. The reason for this phenomenon is obvious that the concept is too absurd that few can understand. Therefore, experts tend to give a critical judgment to be seriously valued, especially when it come to the field like pure physics or math.

However, the critical judgment with a high value are not necessarily comes from the experts. Many of the great observations and suggestions are come from the local people. This is especially true in politic field. Many experts are showing support for a specific candidate when selection, claiming that the candidate have the quality that is most beneficial for the prosperity of the country. But what if there are some background activities like the candidate hold big stakes of the experts and his or her winning can exert significant influence on the experts' benefit. What if there are some biases hold commonly by the candidate and the expert but turn out to be not beneficial for the development of the country in the long run. The mass is much more likely to tell the truth even with gut. Supposed that all the views and suggestions from the mass are heard and are later substantiated, the country is likely to develop more swiftly and healthily. So, the crucial judgments of the mass are definitely more valuable than the 'experts' who is probable to do in their own favor in this circumstance.

Therefore, judgments from the general public are even more likely to the one to be valued and referred to because they represent the benefit of the mass while the experts merely composed of a small proportion of the total population. Specially. there are circumstances that author's assertion is almost one hundred percent true like in the field of pure math and physics where barely any people understand the concepts and methods.
