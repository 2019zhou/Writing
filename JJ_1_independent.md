As the leader of a city, what would you do to ensure the prosperity and success of the city?


# My writing
I really appreciate what the last leader did in his last 4 years of administration. Maggie (the city's name) is now developing fast and with yet an even better tendency to become the most prosperous city in the country. I absolutely feel the responsibility and pressure to ensure the success and prosperity of Maggie. We plan to do the 
following things to better improve the city.

First, Rules and laws will be more strictly implemented to ensure the security, equality and order of the city. There are some areas in the city that violence occasionally occurs. We will strengthen the regulations there to improve the tough situation. An even more intelligent system will be put into use to watch real-time situation on the streets, and allocate the police wisely to where they are needed. This system will assist the police in preventing the violence just in time. At the same time, the automation of watch street situations will prove to cut the government cost as well for fewer people are needed to do this watching job.

Secondly, a new Industry Park called "future here" is going to put into use in this year. We will try our best to lower the cost of companies getting in to attract more promising companies. The government now has a plan for around $500 million to advocate the young and small-scale companies. We will try to make the money into full use and 
stimulate the creativity of those companies. We also plan to invite some large companies to get into the Industry Park "future here", and much more jobs will be created. We hope these kinds of actions will significantly lower the unemployment rate and attract more talents to get into this city.

Thirdly, we will have a big budget on the investment of city's infrastructures. Around $1000 million will be put into improve the city's infrastructures in five years. more trees and plants will be planted to improve the downtown environment. A central park like that in the New York is hopefully to be built to give people a great place to relax after a tired day in the city. The underground system and the bus system will be improved and we will encourage more people to use those public transportation to save the money and protect the environment as well. We eagerly want to make a better life for the citizens in the city. 

The above are the brief introduction of the plans I will advocate doing during my tenure. We plan to enhance regulation implementations, invite more investment and improve the city's infrastructures. I hope these actions can ensure the prosperity and success of the whole city.
