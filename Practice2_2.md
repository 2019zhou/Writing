# My writing
The government faces the trade-off at the times of economic crisis. It needs to minimize the cost of reducing its spending. Given the options that eliminating cost on education, health care or support for the unemployed, I prefer to choose cut down the expense on support for the unemployed.

First of all, expenses on education shouldn't be cut down at any period, that is no matter the economic situation is remarkable or dooming. Because a high-qualified education makes the talents. The talents are able to better the social condition, even reversing the economic recession at a critical time. For instance, president Roosevelt successfully led the American out of the Great Depression in 1930s. Given that he and his team had not received relevant education, they probably failed to make those tremendously successful decisions and led the economy back to its trail. In addition, education equips people with the skills and with these skills people are able to find a satisfying job. Thus, it is education that gives rise to lower the unemployment rate and promote the economic growth.

Secondly, health care is critical for the well-being of the whole society, and reducing the cost will lower the trust and satisfaction for the government.  It is high likely that the government will lose much of its vote for cutting down the health care expense. In addition, a scattering of the distrust and disappointment of government is likely to drug the economy deeper into recession. Because fewer masses are confident that the economy will be strong again. And the common concern actually becomes a self-fulfilling story. Therefore, the government should take the responsibility of elevating the confidence of the entire society by means of not reducing the health care.

Thirdly, support for the unemployed can be reduced. And the fact is that many countries actually have far too fancy welfare policies that resulting in the unemployment rate keeping high. Reducing this part of support is likely to force more people to find a job and make some contributions to the whole economy. Instead of staying at home and living by the government unemployment benefits, the young have to equip with skills that society needs and step into the cruel competition. While this seems rather cruel and inhumane, it is worthwhile to do and pay its cost. The government ought to alter to try to reduce the unemployment rate. And this way proves to cost the least comparing to the other two.

I propose that the government should reduce the support for the unemployment rather than cutting down the expenses on education and health care. Education contributes to the advert of talents and equip people with skills. And health care is likely to improving the confidence of the masses. Both two are more likely to drug the economy out of the recession. On the contrary, the support for the unemployment will do otherwise. Therefore, reducing the support for the unemployment is the best option.
