# My writing

There are two totally different ways for grading. One is grade by numerous small assignments. The other is only graded on large assignments. Some students prefer the former because the assignment is a lot easier. And even if messing up on one or two, it makes little difference to the final result . I deem it the other way however. I prefer to choose have my score determined by the few large projects.

To start with, big tasks are more focused and easier for me to concentrate my attention. It is my personal feeling that small tasks are troublesome and even boring sometimes. They are quite resemble to the homework we did in our elementary school, mostly about remembering and calculating.  But those practices have already been done by numerous people. They are by no means creative. Additionally, it is so distracting to be forced to leave out a specific time to complete a task rather than do a complete and exciting big thing.  If I have to complete those numerous small tasks, it is probably that I will not take those seriously and be so bored that do a bad job. However, big tasks are more focused. I only need to concentrate on a few and thus I am more confident to get a higher score.

Furthermore, grading on large assignments motivates me to complete the works resembling real-life tasks. Large assignments are integrated, challenging and sometimes require good cooperation. And these features is quite useful in practice, especially in future career. Because most of the works nowadays are some demanding tasks and need a group of people to discuss and find out the best possible way. For instance, I was once assigned a project to write a student management system. It is a really difficult task for me at that time. But the grading requirements just push me on complete the task. I coded for totally three weeks and finally got "A". And this kind of requirement of making a management system turns out to be very common in the real-life events. So completing the task benefits me a lot.

However, the drawbacks of grading only based on those large projects are quite obvious. We are so desperate at the deadline and are sometimes forced to stay up late at night to get the work done. Yet, I still hold the view that it is kind of good practice. Through the process of chasing the deadline, we learned that importance to prevent procrastination. The challenging , demanding long essays test our patience and perseverance. And at the very end, we feel the achievement of complete the task and get improved in comprehensive aspects.

Therefore, I prefer to choose those large projects as part of my grade. Big projects are more focused and easier to concentrate my attention. It is more likely that I will do a better job and get a higher grade. They are more creative and challenging, serving as a purpose to improve my skills. They are more similar to the future works we will be doing, thus having more practical meaning. Grading on them will motivate me to improve my skills.
